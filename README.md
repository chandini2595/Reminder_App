# Reminder_App

1. Introduction

The Reminder App is a web application designed to allow users to manage personal reminders. It provides features such as user registration, login, and the ability to add and view reminders. This project demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using Python and Flask while incorporating authentication, form validation, and secure password management.

2. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a fully functional web application that allows users to:

	•	Register and create a personal account.
	•	Log in to their account securely.
	•	Add and view personal reminders.
	•	Log out to terminate the session.

3. Technology Stack

Backend Technologies:

	•	Flask: A lightweight web framework used for routing, handling requests, and rendering templates.
	•	Flask-WTF: A Flask extension that integrates with WTForms for form handling and validation.
	•	Flask-SQLAlchemy: An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions.
	•	SQLite: A lightweight, serverless database used to store user and reminder information.
	•	Flask-Login: Manages user authentication and session handling in Flask applications.
	•	Werkzeug: Used for password hashing and verification, ensuring secure password storage.

Frontend Technologies:

	•	HTML: Used for structuring the content of the web pages.
	•	CSS: Used for styling the web pages (optional, not implemented in this demo).
	•	Jinja2: Flask’s templating engine, used to dynamically generate HTML pages based on backend logic.

4. Features

User Registration

	•	Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
	•	Password validation is enforced to ensure the user enters matching passwords.
	•	The password is securely hashed using the pbkdf2:sha256 method from Werkzeug before being stored in the database.

User Login

	•	Users can log in using their registered credentials.
	•	Login validation ensures that only users with correct credentials can access the application.

Reminders Dashboard

	•	Once logged in, users are redirected to a dashboard where they can add new reminders.
	•	Reminders are stored in a database and are associated with the logged-in user.
	•	Users can view all their reminders in a list format.

Logout

	•	Users can securely log out of their account, which ends the session and redirects them back to the home page.

5. Application Flow

	    1.	Home Page: Users are presented with options to either register or log in.
	    2.	Registration Page: Users create an account by entering a username and password, which is validated before submission.
	    3.	Login Page: Registered users log in using their credentials. On successful login, they are redirected to the dashboard.
	    4.	Dashboard: Users can add new reminders and view existing reminders in a list format.
	    5.	Logout: Users can securely log out, terminating the session and returning to the home page.

6. Code Walkthrough     

6.1 Application Structure

The main code is organized into the following sections:

	•	app.py: The core application logic, including routing, form handling, and database models.
	•	templates/: HTML templates used to render the user interface.
	•	home.html: The landing page with links to login or register.
	•	register.html: The user registration form.
	•	login.html: The user login form.
	•	reminders.html: The dashboard where users can add and view reminders.

6.2 Backend Logic

	  1.	User and Reminder Models:
      The User and Reminder classes are defined as SQLAlchemy models to represent users and their reminders in the database. Each reminder is linked to a specific user using a foreign key (user_id).
    2. 	Form Handling:
    Flask-WTF is used to define forms for registration, login, and adding reminders. The forms include validators to ensure data integrity (e.g., matching passwords during registration).
    
6.3 Authentication:

    Flask-Login manages the user session. The login_user() function logs the user in, and the @login_required decorator protects certain routes (e.g., the dashboard), ensuring only authenticated users can access them.

6.4 Reminder Management:
        
    Users can add reminders from the dashboard, and each reminder is saved in the database along with the user ID.

6.3 Templating (Jinja2)

    HTML templates are used to dynamically generate web pages based on data passed from the backend. Jinja2 allows rendering of forms and content in a clean, structured way.
7. Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app is fully functional, there are several areas for potential enhancement:

	•	Add Email Notifications: Send reminder notifications via email to users.
	•	User Profile Management: Allow users to update their profiles (e.g., change passwords).
	•	Reminder Editing and Deletion: Implement features for users to edit or delete their reminders.
	•	Data Persistence in Cloud: Move the app to a more scalable database like PostgreSQL and deploy it on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a complete web application using Flask, SQLite, and various Flask extensions. The app provides a simple yet functional interface for user management and reminder creation. It highlights key web development concepts such as form validation, user authentication, and secure password management.

9. Installation and Setup Instructions

To set up the Reminder App locally:

	    2.	Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
      3.  Initialize the database.
      4.  Run the app.
      5. 	Open the app in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000
